Here, you'll find a collection of things I am proud of having built or worked on, including this website! Things are still in progress, but for now enjoy the wonderfully swirly background picture from one of my fluid dynamics simulations. This is a rendering of the buoyancy in a convecting fluid: red blobs rise and blue blobs fall. Take a second to observe the whole thing; what shapes stand out to you?</p>
