 <hr class="my-4">
 <p class="lead"><p>This is the course website for the Summer 2019 session of ASTR-2600. This class is a first course in Python for astronomy majors at <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/aps/undergraduate-students/prospective-students">CU Boulder</a>. We will cover Python basics, including JuPyter, iPython, and numpy, as well as data visualization using matplotlib and related libraries.</p></p>

<p><strong>TBD</strong></p>
<h3>Class Location:</h3>
<p>Sommers-Bausch Observatory room S125 (the computer lab)</p>
<h3>Instructor:</h3>
<p><a href="/index.html">Gabriel H. Ortiz-Pe√±a</a> </p>
<h3>Office Hours:</h3>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> SBO Library</p>
<p><strong>Time:</strong> TBD</p>
<h3>Pre-Requisites:</h3>
<p>There are no formal prerequisites for this course. 
However, this course will be easier for you if you have experience with high school algebra, geometry, and physics, and have an understanding of scientific notation. 
It would be <em>extremely</em> helpful if you already have taken or are currently enrolled in calculus.</p>
<h2>Why take this class?</h2>
<p>The techniques you will learn in this course will enable you to do complex scientific calculations with a powerful programming language. 
This is a basic requirement for astrophysics research, and for general science, engineering, and information technology. 
You will have to think logically and linearly, and after this class you will be able teach yourself more extensive computer programming in Python and other programming languages. 
Thus, this course is for students who want to learn a valuable skill and a way of thinking that will prepare them for astrophysics research or other technical fields.</p>
<h1>Goals</h1>
<p>This is what students in the class will learn. 
The broad <strong>learning goals</strong> will be addressed by the specific <strong>competencies</strong> that we will be developing together. 
My hope is that these are appropriate in terms of the time we will have and in terms of the students' prior knowledge.
If we find that these goals are either too ambitious or not challenging enough, we can change them.
This section will be updated if the course goals change.</p>
