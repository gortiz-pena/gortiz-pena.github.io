  <p><a href="http://jolt.merlot.org/vol2no3/finkelstein.htm">This</a> paper by Finklestein, et al. is a general-purpose description of the Physics Education Technology (PhET) project, covering both the development process of the included simulations, and research on the project’s effectiveness. 
Each simulation’s design team—typically comprised of a programmer, a content expert, and an education specialist—uses a backwards design approach that starts from goals, and iterates based on feedback from the larger PhET team and from student testing. 
From the abstract: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The [successful] simulations: support an iterative approach, employ dynamic feedback, follow a constructivist approach, provide a creative workplace, make inaccessible or implicit models explicit, and constrain students productively.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the evaluation of the simulations, the authors report that two different introductory physics lecture settings show significantly higher learning gains when they use PhET simulations instead of physical demonstrations, and that students in upper-level physical chemistry classes also benefit from their inclusion. 
Laboratory section research shows the same, and maybe even more dramatic results: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>These data indicate that students learning with the simulation are more capable at understanding, constructing, and writing about real circuits than their counterparts who had been working with real circuit elements all along. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In recitation sections, students that use the simulated circuits in their tutorials generally do better on midterms than students who work with real circuits, but students who used a simulation in a different tutorial on waves did not show similar improvements. 
In informal settings, using the simulations had little impact on learning, <em>except</em> when students were asked a concept question as a prediction, then prompted to play with the simulation, and then asked the question again. 
The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of how the simulations are used in each context: the technology on its own has little impact on student learning, it’s how students interact with the technology that has the most influence on learning.</p>
<p><strong>Impressions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I like that the design process is outlined explicitly in the paper, and that it starts with the learning goals of the simulation. Do instructors who use PhET find that these are broadly appropriate, or do they have to design their demo lectures around the simulation lesson?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do students that engage with circuit simulations that don't show the flowing electron visualization perform somewhere between the two groups described here?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students interacting with simulations will pay attention to different things. By asking students a question before they play with the simulations, we tell them what to pay attention to (and what to learn, by extension). Is there research that used open-ended interviews with students in unstructured environments to see what they end up learning from simulations when they play first?</p>
