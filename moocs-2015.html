  <p>In <a href="https://www.compadre.org/PER/items/detail.cfm?ID=13512">this</a> study, Dubson and colleagues compared a Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) and a presential introductory mechanics for physics majors and found that while online students do about as well, a much lower fraction of them complete the course.
The MOOC version of the class was designed to be as similar as possible to the “brick-and-mortar” version of the class; the main difference being that the online version didn’t include the UW tutorials and the lectures were edited to remove student discussion.
Both versions used concept questions during the lectures, and had the same online homework assignments.
In terms of demographics, the MOOC students were better educated, older, and more diverse than the college students.</p>
<p>Students coming into both courses showed very similar distributions of previous physics knowledge, as measured by the Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation (FMCE) pre-test: when starting the class most students know very little, but the top 10% of students know a lot.
As the course moved on, the MOOC students dropped out at a much higher rate than the college students.
While 80% of the CU Boulder students enrolled at the start of the semester passed the class (had a class average of 60% or more), only about 2% of the MOOC students achieved the same milestone.
In a really cool plot, the authors show that the MOOC students that stay are the best prepared. 
After each midterm exam, the average FMCE pre-test score for the MOOC students that took that midterm gradually increases from about 40% to 65%, while the presential course’s pre-test scores stay near 40% throughout the semester.
Finally, another example of sweet data analysis showed that, when midterm scores are binned according to each student’s FMCE pre-test scores, MOOC students perform about as well as the college students on the exams.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>MOOC students know about the same physics content as traditional college students before starting an introductory mechanics course.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It looks like MOOCs are significantly more diverse than traditional college courses (at least at CU Boulder)! This looks like a great opportunity to increase the diversity of physics majors in the U.S.</p>
</li>
</ul>
