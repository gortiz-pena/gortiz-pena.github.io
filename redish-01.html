  <p>Physics Education Research (PER) has shown that traditional lecture-style classes are ineffective at getting students to learn physics.
This textbook summarizes those results and other research that demonstrates the educational techniques that foster learning.
This first chapter begins with an overview of <em>The Physics Suite</em>, a set of integrated instructional materials designed to effectively foster student learning.
The rest of the chapter is focused on motivating the rest of the text and, specifically, motivating the need to radically change the way that physics is taught.</p>
<p>First, Redish makes what I consider to be a weak argument that the changing demographics of physics classrooms are a major reason why physics education is not serving its purposes anymore.
The author moves on to pose the central concern of the textbook: traditional physics teaching leads students to dislike physics, to feel that it is entirely disconnected from their daily lives and long-term goals, and fails to prepare them with the skills they need to succeed in later, more advanced science classes.
To address the issue, Redish cites education and cognitive psychology researchers to say that physics educators need to focus on what students learn, rather than what they are teaching, and that learning is not the same as succeeding in class.
Sagredo, an ignorant but thoughtful interlocutor, is introduced, and his complaint---that focusing on teaching “middle of the road” students will end up boring high-achieving physics majors---is countered with research that has shown that high-achieving students actually gain more understanding than the average student from the educational reforms that education researchers advocate for.</p>
<p>The rest of the chapter motivates PER as its own branch of science worth tackling on its own.
The section begins with a nice operational definition of science: a community that collaborates to create the best possible way of thinking about the world.
Redish argues that all knowledge resides in individual scientists’ minds, and that the community consensus that emerges from the collective culture of scientists is a useful and meaningful way of representing the physical world.
Creating true, robust, and useful knowledge about teaching and learning physics requires the same effort, rigor, and community standards as doing the same for physics in general.
The chapter concludes with some anecdotes that illustrate the severe need for PER and then discusses the maddeningly complex nature of learning. </p>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>In Redish’s opinion, physics education had been serving its purpose before PER started showing its deficiencies.
I would argue that physics education had been poor even when he went to college, and that it's survivorship bias that makes it seem like it was ever effective.</p>
