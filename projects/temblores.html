		<p class='lead'> At the tail end of 2019, a sequence of earthquakes began affecting the southwestern coast of Puerto Rico. The largest shake was a devastating 6.4 magnitude earthquake on 7 January 2020, which was felt across the entire island. Aftershocks continue, and are predicted to persist for anywhere from months to years. While it is impossible to describe the full impact of the event in numbers, I hope to elucidate a small part of that story here.</p>

<h2>I. Statistics</h2>

<p>After seeing a couple of different ways to visualize the swarm, I was inspired to add my own take. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has been publishing a seven-day aftershock forecast since their initial report on the sequence. They report a probability of earthquakes higher than some key magnitudes in the following seven days. I want to see how well a strictly statistical analysis could recreate their reported forecast, and estimate how the probability of a major earthquake in the area has changed since the sequence started.</p>

<p>USGS publishes data from recent quakes through their <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/"><b>API</b></a>, and before focusing on the swarm, I took the chance to look at historical data for the Guánica area. Data looks to have started being collected around 1994, with the data before then limited to a few moderately strong earthquakes (mag 3-4.5). Since then, there had been no earthquakes greater than magnitude 4.5, and only 5 greater than magnitude 4. As a reference, on the week of 12 January to 19 January there were a total of 54 earthquakes greater than magnitude 4, more than ten times as many shakes in a week than in the previous twenty-six years. Any way you look at it, both the frequency and intensity of earthquakes in the area have increased since the start of 2020.</p>

<h3>First steps</h3>
<p>The USGS forecast reports the probability of an earthquake of magnitude 3 or greater in the next 7 days, so my first instinct is to look at the data in that way.  To do that, I separated the data by magnitude and counted how many fell in that range each week. For example, on the week from 12 January to 19 January, there were a total of 95 earthquakes with magnitudes between 3 and 3.5. The figure below shows this for all of the magnitude ranges that I chose. </p>

</div>

<h2> To be continued...</h2>
<p>I still need to choose a way to model the earthquakes that allows me to make predictions based on past data. Before moving forward, I would check whether the latest earthquake frequency for each magnitude is enough to match the forecast.  </p>
